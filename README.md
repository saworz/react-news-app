# About the app

My first React steps, app uses [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) and enables user to query and search articles from around the world. On the main page user can sort articles by some general categories and on the Search News page there are more precise filters. In order to use the API you have to create an account on [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) and copy the API Key into the Settings.
